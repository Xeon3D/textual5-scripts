# textual5-scripts
My scripts for the Textual 5 IRC Client

Download them and right click the .scpt file and choose Open With -> Textual 5 to install them.

or open a terminal window and do:

git clone http://github.com/xeon3d/textual5-scripts ~/Library/Application\ Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual5/

To update to the latest versions :

cd ~/Library/Application\ Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual5/ && git pull

Scripts whose name ends in 4 are not yet updated for Textual 5.

The si script still has some bugs regarding HDD detection, but the scripts are not going to be supported nor worked on by me anymore. Feel free to fork them and edit them to your liking, just don't forget to name me anywhere in the script if you can...
